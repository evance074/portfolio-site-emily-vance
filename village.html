                <h3>Case Study: Designing a Digital Intervention for Postpartum Depression Support</h3>
                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project aimed to design a digital intervention for raising awareness about postpartum depression
                    (PPD) and its impact on maternal health. The focus was on creating an informative, supportive
                    platform that would reach new mothers, healthcare providers, and caregivers with educational
                    resources. Given the complexity of the health issue and the need for accurate information, this
                    project was grounded in public health theory and research rather than traditional user interviews or
                    testing.</p>
                <p>This project was a unique challenge: to design a digital intervention aimed at increasing awareness
                    of postpartum depression (PPD), reducing stigma, and encouraging early help-seeking. Unlike
                    traditional UX projects, this work did not involve user interviews or usability testing due to the
                    sensitive nature of the topic and early-stage conceptualization. Instead, the foundation was built
                    entirely on public health theory, behavioral science, and in-depth desk research.</p>
                <p>Rather than designing around user preferences, the process centered on understanding the clinical,
                    social, and psychological factors surrounding PPD—and translating that into a meaningful,
                    compassionate digital experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>The Health Context</h2>
                <p>Postpartum depression (PPD) affects up to 20% of new mothers, with symptoms emerging within the first
                    year of childbirth. The condition can last for months or even years, impacting both mental health
                    and physical well-being. In some cases, the symptoms of PPD can remain undetected for long periods,
                    making early intervention critical to improving outcomes. This case study explores the design of a
                    solution to address these challenges, using the lens of public health theory and research.

                <h2>Challenges and Insights</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Limited Detection and Delayed Treatment: Despite the significant impact of PPD, many women are
                        not diagnosed or treated until much later. Often, the symptoms begin much earlier than women
                        disclose to healthcare providers. This delay in detection can be linked to a lack of awareness
                        or the stigma surrounding mental health issues.</li>
                    <li>Stigma and Social Inequalities: Social factors such as poverty, discrimination, and a lack of
                        social support can exacerbate the challenges of coping with PPD. Women who face multiple
                        inequalities are at higher risk, and the stigma associated with mental health conditions can
                        prevent them from seeking help. Addressing these social factors within the intervention design
                        was critical for creating an effective solution.</li>
                    <li>Complexity of the Health Issue: The relationship between PPD and factors like prenatal
                        depression, stressful life events, and poor social support made it clear that a multifaceted
                        approach was required. Additionally, as 30% of younger mothers (aged 25 and below) experience
                        PPD, the design needed to be tailored to reach this specific demographic.</li>
                </ol>

            <div id="village-project-requirements">
                <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
                <p>To address these multifaceted challenges, the proposed digital experience included the following key
                    components:</p>

                <h4>A Personalized Homepage</h4>
                <p>A calm, supportive landing space where mothers can track their emotional well-being over time, see
                    uplifting affirmations or supportive tips, and access relevant tools or resources. Designed to feel
                    like a check-in, not a diagnosis.</p>
                <h4>Community Connection Feature</h4>
                <p>Recognizing the power of peer support, this feature would allow mothers to connect anonymously with
                    others experiencing similar emotions—via moderated forums, group chats, or shared stories—to reduce
                    isolation and foster belonging.
                </p>
                <h4>Screening Tool for PPD</h4>
                <p>A self-guided, clinically validated screener (e.g. EPDS or PHQ-9) that allows users to check in with
                    themselves and receive guidance on next steps. The tone would be warm and reassuring, reinforcing
                    that seeking help is a sign of strength—not failure.</p>
                <h4>Resource Library</h4>
                <p>A curated library of local resources, articles, videos, and support materials about PPD, mental
                    health, and self-care practices, with content tailored to different stages of the postpartum
                    journey. This would help users feel informed, empowered, and less alone.</p>
                <h4>Partner Companion App</h4>
                <p>An optional, pared-down version of the app for partners, designed to raise awareness and offer tools
                    to check in on the mother’s emotional state and learn how to provide better support. This supports
                    shared responsibility and encourages proactive caregiving.</p>
                <h4>Ask for Help Button</h4>
                <p>A frictionless way for mothers to request help from pre-selected contacts or local services—whether
                    that means a ride to an appointment, a babysitting break, or emotional support. This would be
                    customizable and designed to minimize guilt or shame.
                </p>

                <p>Although this project didn't involve interviews or user testing, I moved through a full design

                    <h3>Design System</h3>
                    <p>The prototype was built using Material Design 3, chosen for its accessibility, robust component
                        system, and familiarity in health-tech interfaces. MD3 helped ensure consistency across states,
                        interactions, and screen sizes, while still allowing flexibility for visual softness and
                        personalization.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>This project pushed me to think differently about what UX can look like—especially when the
                        “users” are not yet at the table. Without direct interviews or usability testing, I leaned
                        heavily on public health theory, behavioral research, and clinical data to inform design
                        decisions. That experience deepened my respect for the nuances of health-related design work,
                        especially when dealing with topics like stigma, mental health, and social inequality.
                    </p>
                    <p>Designing for postpartum depression required a trauma-informed lens, an equity-centered mindset,
                        and constant reflection on how design choices could either reinforce or reduce stigma. Every
                        feature—whether a screening quiz or a community chat—had to balance clinical accuracy with
                        emotional safety.


                    </p>
                    <p>Through this process, I also became more confident in advocating for multi-user experiences (like
                        the partner app), and I saw the importance of designing not just for individuals but for their
                        ecosystems of care. Receiving feedback from public health peers reminded me that
                        cross-disciplinary collaboration strengthens design outcomes, especially in complex issue areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>If this project were to move forward, I'd prioritize co-design sessions with new mothers,
                        healthcare providers, and community support networks to validate assumptions and ensure the tool
                        is relevant, accessible, and emotionally safe.</p>
